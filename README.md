# How samples behave from a normally distributed population

This tidyverse `R` script shows that drawing samples from a normally distributed population do not necessarily mean the samples will behave (look) like a normal distribution.

To follow along with this `R` script, first, you will need to watch the
following videos created by Mike Marin to get the sampling concept.
